# wuh-on-rails

Code generation tools for WUH apps

## WUH

WUH stands for Web Components, Unison, and Htmx.

For quick intro talk, see [The WUH stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l5MJIZLQ2M)

## Code generation

This project exists as a tool to bootstrap and then rapidly generate common code in WUH apps, in an opinionated way. Heavily inspired by Rails and Django.

The current plan is to use a combo of [transcripts](https://www.unison-lang.org/docs/tooling/transcripts/) and Plop. But it would be nice to build our own CLI to abstract over these

## Todos

- Full service generator, based on Crud: ability, model, routes
- Add auth generator
